  Skye SKates is an ecommerce website which showcases my understanding of react, SQL databases and the creation of persistent data systems. This full stack website has been established through the utilization of the technologies of the MERN stack.
   <br>
    <i> Sky Skates was created using MongoDB, Node.js and Express.js - ultimately allowing for the creation of this full stack website.</i>

![image2](DV200_T3_SkySkates/src/Images/mockups/mockup1.png)


### Easy access to the top roller skates on the market! 
Skye Skates provides users with a user-friendly shopping experience! Showcasing all the stores available products, and providing the ability to customise the products to your liking. Once you have added this to your cart, you can enter your details and those skates are yours!


### See the latest arivals!
Skye Skates wants to make your life easier. So to do that, we have showcased our latest arrivals on our home page! To provide fast and easy access - we want to make sure you can get your hands on the pair you've been waiting for.


### Authorised Access Only!
We want to protect both parties when using our website, therefore, we implemented an authentication system, ensuring that only our valued members have access!


### Easy inventory managment!
Inventory managment has never been easier. We have created a user friendly inventory system, allowing for easy editing, updating and removal of stock! Not only this, but we have also provided the ability to track your orders and dispatch them when necessary.

### Secure data storage
Safety comes first for Sky Skates, therefore, we have stored all delicate information safely on an external database - Mongo DB Atlas.

### Animations
We wanted to enhance our users experience to a new level and therefore introduced animtions to the mix. The subtle animations allow for a more interactive website that enhances its energetic feel.

### Emailer
Furthermore, we provided the opportunity for users to recieve emails from skye skates. This will allow us to keep our users up to date with all Sky Skates has to offer.

<!-- CONCEPT PROCESS -->
<!-- Briefly explain your concept ideation process -->
<!-- here you will add things like wireframing, data structure planning, anything that shows your process. You need to include images-->
## Concept Process

The `Conceptual Process` is the set of actions, activities and research that was done when starting this project.

### Ideation
In order to begin my website ideation process, I first needed to choose a product that I would base my ecommerce website on. I chose roller skates as these would allow for a mordern, youthful and energetic approach to the websites design.

### Wireframes
Once I had a clear concept for the website I wanted to achieve, I began creating wireframes.

### Custom UI
I then gained UI and branding inspiration using Pinterest, Behance and Dribble. I found myself gravitating to energetic, playful yet clean designs which I felt would compliment the association to roller skates and create memorable branding for the website.

<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->
## Development Process

The `Development Process` is the technical implementations and functionality done in the frontend and backend of the application.

I began the Development process by creating the front end of my website using react. Here I created the basic framework and routing structure my website would follow. Once this was complete I was able to further enhance the design to create a distinct brand identity. 

Next I began implementing the necessary code on the server side. Utilizing Node.js and Express.js to connect to the database and handle all persistent data. This led to the creation of the product, user and order structures. These determined how all the information would be stored and interacted with in the front end.

Once the server side code had been implemented, I began connecting the front and backend, to create the required functionality. Which required authentication and the updating, adding and deleting of the data items stored in Mongo DB ATlas.

Lastly, I furthered my users experience through experimenting with animations, using framer motion, and sending the users emails using nodemailer.


### Implementation Process
<!-- stipulate all of the functionality you included in the project -->
<!-- This is your time to shine, explain the technical nuances of your project, how did you achieve the final outcome!-->

* The authentication of users using web tokens
* Displaying the newest three products on the home page slider
* The use of nodemailer to send emails
* The displaying of all products in the form of clickable cards
* A detailed view of the product which allows the user to customise the product to their liking and add it to their cart
* The use of local storage to store the users orders before purchase
* The ability to dispatch orders
* The ability to delete, update and add products
* The use of framer motions to create animation
* Displays discounts and adjusts the prices accordingly


#### Highlights
<!-- stipulated the highlight you experienced with the project -->
* Through this project I gained more skills which have aided me in my growth as a developer. 
* Utilizing the MERN stack technologies has extended my capabilities as a full stack developer - helping me gain more experience in my preferred career direction.
* I also found that creating this website pushed me outside my comfort zone but inspired me to explore other dependencies, such as framer motion, to enhance my website.

#### Challenges
<!-- stipulated the challenges you faced with the project and why you think you faced it or how you think you'll solve it (if not solved) -->
* I struggled with adjusting to working with both the client and server side.
* I found that I faced many when connecting these, which resulted in long debuggimh process.
* I particularly struggled with the add and update functions due to the way I structered my product objects.

* However, through numerous trials and errors, i was able to overcome these issues and I was able to gain more confidence in my own abilities.


#### Above And Beyond

What aspects of this final build contribute to the `Above And Beyond` Component of your brief?
<!-- what did you learn outside of the classroom and implement into your project-->
* Here I explored framer motion. This allowed me to expore animation to create a more interactive website.
* I also eplored nodemailer which allowed me to send emails to users, using my website.


### Future Implementation
<!-- stipulate functionality and improvements that can be implemented in the future. -->

* In future I would like to spend more time on adding additional functionality, as I feel as though I have not reached my full potencial as a developer and this could help grow mt skills and confidence.
* I would like to push myself further in creating interactive designs which provide for a industry standard user experience.
